project proposal

Our project for this course will be a somewhat sophisticated alarm clock consisting of an
alarm system attached to our arduino toy car.
Why will you make it?

The team believes that there is a market for this product and came to the conclusion, at the
first customer meeting, that the client seemed to approve of this particular idea amongst our
proposals - it would be a great solution to people who has issues waking up in the morning.
Besides for the actual functionality, itâ€™s also a fun and innovative product.
How are you going to make it?

We will start by creating a GUI using MIT app inventor2. After creating this, if we find that
there is time for more complex alternatives, then we will also try to implement the same GUI
into Android Studio. As for the coding of the alarm clock-car we will use vote on whether we'll
use C-Lion or arduino IDE.

The GUI will have a very intuitive interface where you set the alarm and the information gets
sent to the car. When the time that was set by the customer comes the car will start its alarm
and ring while the car is starting to drive around in a randomized way, avoiding obstacles
and if we have the time we'd like to make it notice moving objects such as humans and
therefore avoid the person.

What kind of technology you are going to use?

For this we will need a few more components than what has been provided. Requested
components are as follows :
1. Big button to turn off alarm, preferably some type of device that can be connected to the
top of the car
2. Two more ultrasonic sensors to be able to read surrounding in 360 degrees angle.
3. (Maybe) a second plastic plate to place our four sensors, if not then we will need a
solution to attaching the sensor on each side.
4. Infrared sensor
5.Mini breadboard for sensors.
6.Speaker to sound an alarm.
